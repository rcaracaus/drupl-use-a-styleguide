<h2>Should we ditch the fugly?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We wouldn't have to follow two abstraction holes.</li>
  <li>The variation is stored in the actual markup rather than creating maps and organizing the fuglies.</li>
  <li>Less front-end code, more mapping with PHP in template.php</li>
  <li>Your front-end is abstraction is free of Drupalisms and other arms of organization can use it.</li>
</ul>
